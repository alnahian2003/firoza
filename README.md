Run the database migrations (set the database connection in `.env` before migrating):

### TL;DR

All the command list:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alnahian2003/firoza.git
```

```bash
cd firoza

```

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

```bash
php artisan serve
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Database Seeding

Populate the database with seed data that includes relationships. This can help you quickly get started and explore the project inside out.

Run the database seeder once to get:

-   10 Categories
-   30 Fake Posts
-   1 Admin User

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

Next time you run the `db:seed` artisan command, try running it by specifying the seeder class name:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=CategorySeeder,PostSeeder
```

Note: It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command:

```bash
php artisan migrate:refresh
```
